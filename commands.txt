making app from scratch

npx create-react-app app_name
npm init-gives package.json file, entry points, license
npm i express-gives express module and node modules and pacakge-lock
npm i nodemon-creates node_modules

in package.json file under scripts do
"start":"nodemon app.js",

in node to test we use only console format.

express is used as middle ware

to see the output give
http://localhost:2222/api
here 2222-port number
/api-backend

we use different scenarios in app.js by changing backend i.e, by
changing /api with anything, and also make changes in the app.js

app.use('/api',(req,res,next)=>{
    res.send("Hello World!");
})
here change /api with anything we want
